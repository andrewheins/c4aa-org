# The C4AA.org WordPress Theme

[C4AA.org](https://c4aa.org)

A child theme of the standard [WordPress Twenty Nineteen](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentynineteen/) theme.

Our aims are:

## 1. Create a site that aligns with the C4AA Design Standards

We have some design standards created by Diane Shaw, then built upon over the years in our C4AA print material.

## 2. Code as few modifications as possible.

Minimize use of plugins, javascript, and other dependencies. Hopefully avoid front-end plugins entirely.

### Plugins we are using:

- [Our Lazy Loader](https://github.com/thec4aa/simple-lazy-loader)
- [Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/) - just to get upcoming features early.
- [Akismet](https://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/) - we don't really use comments, but why not.
- Jetpack
- [Give - Donation Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/give/) - we use this to process and manage donations. We're subscribers and use some of their add-ons as well.
- [A Simple Lazy Loader](https://github.com/thec4aa/simple-lazy-loader) - especially because international and/or mobile users are a larger audience for the site.  @Lara126 wrote this based on a tutorial.
- [EWWW Image Optimizer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ewww-image-optimizer/) - not everyone using the site knows how to optimize images or wants to bother with it.
- Advanced Custom Fields
- Blubrry PowerPress - for our podcast
- Contact Form 7
- Post SMTP
- (more to be included later)
